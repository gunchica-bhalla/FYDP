7-7-2022 0:23:57,ahecker@uwaterloo.ca,Male,car expert,18-20,Diagnosis by mechanic to determine defective parts prior to repairing the vehicle myself,"Spare tire, appears to be a space saving spare tire but could also be a full size spare for a smaller or older vehicle with narrow tires as it is mounted to a 4 bolt rim","Tire iron, looks pretty basic but also has a pretty basic function (not sure how often these are used on cars, they seem to be more common with bikes, transport trucks and equipment requiring service in place rather than a shop)","Nut, looks like a pretty typical nut with some sort of corrosion resistance (potentially stainless steel? zinc plated?)","Nyloc nut, looks pretty standard and does not appear to be used as the nylon insert seems to be in mint condition","Scissor jack, looks pretty solid compared to jacks included by some manufacturers (not plastic @chevy) the hook/eyelet for the crank also looks pretty good and would allow for the operator to be standing while operating it","Engine cover, plastic cosmetic cover overtop of the engine to ""protect"" it as well as reduce noise/ improve the aesthetics of the engine bay","Battery, appears to be a standard lead-acid plate battery with 6 cells (based on the assumption the covers on the top are the cell port covers) could also be from a nissan?? the battery holder looks very similar to the one in my vehicle (nissan)","transmission, the item would be the transmission for the vehicle (in this case FWD)","CV axle/ half shaft, this would be the cv axle/ half shaft assembly connecting the transmission (3) and the drive wheels (front wheels as this car is FWD) allowing for the power to be transmitted to them.","Catalytic converter, a part of most modern vehicle's emission systems and works to remove toxic emissions through some reaction inside (I'm not 100% sure how it works but it involves some precious metals and catalyzes the toxic emissions into less toxic emissions). They are a target for thieves due to the scrap value of the metals inside and ease of removal with a sawzall or angle grinder","muffler, in this case an aftermarket system (maybe titanium??) used to reduce the noise of the engine or in the case of an aftermarket performance exhaust improve performance and allow the engine note to be heard.",Tail pipe?? the visible section of the exhaust when looking at the car on the ground. This looks to be a chrome one that slips over the existing tailpipe and is potentially aftermarket,"disc brake system, this is an example of a disc brake system used in most modern vehicles, the rotor in the photo appears to be a corrosion resistant one that is painted in the middle to prevent it from seizing to either the hub behind it or the wheel that gets installed over it. It also appears that this is after a typical brake replacement as there is brake dust on the spray shield and the caliper appears to be ""previously enjoyed"" but the rotor and pads appear unused. ","spring, this spring appears to be on an independent rear suspension and includes rubber bump stops to prevent damage/noise when it is bottomed out. It also appears to be installed on a performance vehicle and may be aftermarket","fuel tank / fuel cell, the fuel tank as well as the sending unit and potentially the fuel filter. Included in the sending unit is the pick-up, pump as well as the float to determine the level of the tank. Some more modern vehicles also include the fuel filter into this unit. "
